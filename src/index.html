                            <p> From static forms to Umbraco Forms, and from Examine to Elasticsearch: I've done a lot of varied and intricate work
                                with Umbraco. I've recently helped out on a project for a paint manufacturer, where I completed an "Inspiration"
                                section listing decorating ideas and themes. This required the use of Umbraco's built-in indexing solution, as well
                                as some custom filtering code. The site also uses multiple plugins and APIs to provide the company's branded colours
                                and products consistently and beautifully. </p>

                            <p> I've worked on a wide variety of Sitecore projects, including both customer- and business-facing websites. One
                                example is a major UK supermarket, for which I helped make a retailer-facing site allowing them to check their
                                store's status, update stock orders and order sales materials. This involved integrating with various external APIs,
                                as well as writing our own, in addition to the standard Sitecore build and WFFM integration. </p>
