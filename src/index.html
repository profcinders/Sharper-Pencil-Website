                            Welcome to my site! My name's Rachel Drake, and I'm a Leeds-based Sitecore and Umbraco
                            certified developer, who also happens to draw occasionally. I'm working on a more
                            fully-featured blog at the moment, so stay tuned!

                            In the meantime, I've written some blog posts for a previous employer, if you want to check
                            them out:

                                            I've worked on a wide variety of Sitecore projects, including both customer-
                                            and business-facing websites. One example is a major UK supermarket, for
                                            which I helped make a retailer-facing site allowing them to check their
                                            store's status, update stock orders and order sales materials. This involved
                                            integrating with various external APIs, as well as writing our own, in
                                            addition to the standard Sitecore build and WFFM integration.

                                            From static forms to Umbraco Forms, and from Examine to Elasticsearch: I've
                                            done a lot of varied and intricate work with Umbraco. I've recently helped
                                            out on a project for a paint manufacturer, where I completed an
                                            "Inspiration" section listing decorating ideas and themes. This required the
                                            use of Umbraco's built-in indexing solution, as well as some custom
                                            filtering code. The site also uses multiple plugins and APIs to provide the
                                            company's branded colours and products consistently and beautifully.
