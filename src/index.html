                Welcome to my site! My name's Rachel Drake, and I'm a Leeds-based Sitecore and Umbraco
                certified developer, who also happens to draw occasionally. I'm working on a more
                fully-featured blog at the moment, so stay tuned!

                In the meantime, I've written some blog posts for a previous employer, if you want to check

                        <p>
                            I've worked on a wide variety of Sitecore projects, including both customer- and
                            business-facing websites. One example is a major UK supermarket, for which I helped make a
                            retailer-facing site allowing them to check their store's status, update stock orders and
                            order sales materials. This involved integrating with various external APIs, as well as
                            writing our own, in addition to the standard Sitecore build and WFFM integration.

                            From static forms to Umbraco Forms, and from Examine to Elasticsearch: I've done a lot of
                            varied and intricate work with Umbraco. I've recently helped out on a project for a paint
                            manufacturer, where I completed an "Inspiration" section listing decorating ideas and
                            themes. This required the use of Umbraco's built-in indexing solution, as well as some
                            custom filtering code. The site also uses multiple plugins and APIs to provide the company's
                            branded colours and products consistently and beautifully.
